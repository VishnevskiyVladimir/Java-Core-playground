commit XXX - example of AtomicInteger

For basement taken example from counter package of lesson 25. Used atomicInteger instead of int.

AtomicInteger - thread safety wrapper with atomic operations. It's not synchronized inside.

Instead of this it uses CAS (compare and set/swap). CAS increment:
1. reading value
2. Checking in cycle if read value changed by another thread or not. If changed - reading again. If not - modifying.
